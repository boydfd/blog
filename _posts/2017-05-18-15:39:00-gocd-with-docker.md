## Welfare
If you don't want to know detail, you can download my git repository and everything is ready:
[portal](https://github.com/boydfd/gocd-docker-set-up.git)

## Situation
After Graduated for one year, I have participated 5 projects.In the early time of all projects, we have to setup 
CI/CD, as we already familiar with GoCD, so we use GoCD every time.
  
But, there is a pain point, for every project, we have to download GoCD on virtual machine(physics or cloud). Then 
start server and agent, most time, we should setup 3 or 4 agents to gain power of concurrency.So, we have to do the 
same things for 3 or 4 times.

Of course, we can depend on shell script to do this, But, one more nice way is using docker.

## Basic Use
GoCD already offer official image for server and agent, so we can just use it.

Here is the basic docker-compose:
```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  server:
    container_name: gocd-server
    ports:
      - 8153:8153
      - 8154:8154
    image: gocd/gocd-server:v17.4.0
  agent:
    image: gocd/gocd-agent-alpine-3.5:v17.4.0
    environment:
      - GO_SERVER_URL="https://gocd-server:8154/go"
    links:
      - server:gocd-server
```

Just link them, and set GO_SERVER_URL.

Then use docker-compose to start stack:

	docker-compose up

Now, we get one server and one agent.access localhost:8153(you should be patient to wait server to start), and you 
can see our gocd is already running.

if you want to run more agent, show you the power of docker:  

	docker-compose scale agent=3

Now, we have one serve and 3 agent.You can now config GoCD as before.

## More 

### SSH

Most time, we will make agent to ssh to other machine and run some script, so how can we config our agent to exempt 
from ssh password and first-time known host checking.

To do that, we should do two things:

1. tell ssh don't check known host, so we can mount a volume for agent on /home/go/.ssh/config so, we can change 
config of ssh outside the container.
2. use file to ssh.

this is the docker-compose after doing 2 things above:

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  server:
    container_name: gocd-server
    ports:
      - 8153:8153
      - 8154:8154
    image: gocd/gocd-server:v17.4.0
  agent:
    image: gocd/gocd-agent-alpine-3.5:v17.4.0
    environment:
      - GO_SERVER_URL="https://gocd-server:8154/go"
    links:
      - server:gocd-server
    volumes:
      - ./certs:/home/go/certs
      - ./gocd-agent/config:/home/go/.ssh/config
```

In our config we can add something like this:

	HOST $host
        StrictHostKeyChecking no
        UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null

You have to replace $host to ip or domain.  

And then generate a pair of ssh key, put public key to host, and put private key to ./certs file.

Then, when agent run task, you can use this private key to ssh:

	ssh -i /home/go/certs/$key-name $user@$host

### Persistent Stores
It's very easy, the only thing you need to do is mount `/godata` directory on GoCD server.

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  server:
    container_name: gocd-server
    ports:
      - 8153:8153
      - 8154:8154
    image: gocd/gocd-server:v17.4.0
    volumes:
      - ./godata:/godata
  agent:
    image: gocd/gocd-agent-alpine-3.5:v17.4.0
    environment:
      - GO_SERVER_URL="https://gocd-server:8154/go"
    links:
      - server:gocd-server
    volumes:
      - ./certs:/home/go/certs
      - ./gocd-agent/config:/home/go/.ssh/config
```
